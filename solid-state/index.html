					  <p class="step__header">How I felt after waking up and going to sleep <br>(Nov 1 - Nov 13)</p>
					  <p class="step__desc">This is a calendar of my mood. I started out with
						6 catagories but only ended up using 3. <br>
						<br>During the first week I was sick which is why I was groggy, I started to feel
						physically better around Friday but missing class for a week left me feeling very anxious for th rest of the week.
						<br>
						I was able to get a lot done over the weekend, and being sick gave me a new appreciation
						for being healthy!

					<div class="step" data-step="2">
					  <p class="step__header">Time Tracking <br>(Nov 8 - Nov 14)</p>
					  <p class="step__desc">I tracked how I spent my time each day. I used a tool called "Toggl Track"
						to log time entries each day. <br>
						In terms of data collection, this was definitely the most work. It was challenging to remember to log tasks after I was done.
						Often I would forget and at the end of the day I would have to try and peice together what I did. So this data is definitely
						not perfect.
					  </p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
					  <p class="step__header">Work Breakdown <br>(Nov 8 - Nov 14)</p>
					  <p class="step__desc">This is a breakdown of that work catagory seen in the last section <br>
						As you can see my biggest time sink was this class :p
						<br> The personal catagory was me applying for jobs and maintaining my home media server.
					  </p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
					  <p class="step__header">Water Consumption </p>
					  <p class="step__desc">How much water I drank each day.
						<br>I think that I'm falling below the recomended amount because I get my water from food and other drinks.
						<br>You can also see that I drank much less water than usual from Nov 1 - Nov 6 because I was sick during
						that week.
						
						<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> There is data missing on Nov. 6 & Nov. 7. I decided to leave them blank rather
						than make up data to tell a more honest story.
