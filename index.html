        <p>Hi! My name is TJ.<br> I decided to collect data on myself for a couple weeks to learn about myself but mostly to make some cool graphs out of it.<br>
          <br>
          Start scrolling to see them!

            <p class="step__header">How I felt after waking up and going to sleep 
              <br>(Nov 1 - Nov 13)</p>
            <p class="step__desc">This is a calendar of my mood. I started out with
              6 catagories but only ended up using 3. 
              <br>You can hover over the squares to see the exact dates.

            <p class="step__desc">During the first week I got the cold which is why I felt groggy most of the time.

          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p class="step__desc">The symptoms of my cold went away around Friday but missing class 
              for a week left me behind on work and feeling anxious for the rest of the week.

          <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <p class="step__desc">Yay! I started feeling better here. I was able to get a lot done over the weekend, and being sick gave me a new appreciation
              for being healthy!

            <p class="step__header">Time Tracking <br>(Nov 8 - Nov 14)</p>
            <p class="step__desc">I tracked how I spent my time each day. I used a tool called "Toggl Track"
              to log time entries each day. <br>
              In terms of data collection, this was definitely the most work. It was challenging to remember to log tasks after I was done.
              Often I would forget and at the end of the day I would have to try and piece together what I did. So this data is definitely
              not perfect.

          <div class="step" data-step="6">
            <p class="step__header">Work Breakdown <br>(Nov 8 - Nov 14)</p>
            <p class="step__desc">This is a breakdown of that work category seen in the last section <br>
              As you can see my biggest time sink was this class :p
              <br> The personal category was me applying for jobs and maintaining my home media server.

            <p class="step__header">Actual Data</p>
            <p class="step__desc">This is a screenshot of Toggltrack, the tool I used to collect the temporal
              data.
              <br>Some of the small gaps are because I didn't record my commute time because I knew it's about 30 minutes each day.
              <br>But most of the gaps are because I forgot to record the data.

          <div class="step" data-step="8">
            <p class="step__header">Water Consumption </p>
            <p class="step__desc">How much water I drank each day.
              <br>I think that I'm falling below the recommended amount because I get my water from food and other drinks.
              <br>You can also see that I drank much less water than usual from Nov 1 - Nov 6 because I was sick during
              that week.
              
              <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> There is data missing on Nov. 6 & Nov. 7. I decided to leave them blank rather
              than make up data to tell a more honest story.

        <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
        <br>
        <p>So what did I learn from all this?
          Well for one data collection is not easy! I was planning on collecting data for a whole month
          but I'm glad I limited it to only two weeks. Although it would be a lot more insightful to have a month
          or a years worth of data. It's hard to observe patterns in my life with such limited data. If I could set
          up an easy way to collect data it might be possible to get a years worth. With that being said here's what
          patterns I did notice.
          <br>
          Doing this also made me wonder how it is people do 60-80 hour workdays!
          During the week I collected data I worked for only about 30 hours and I felt like any more
          and it would be too much.
