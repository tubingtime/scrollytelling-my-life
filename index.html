<h1>Scrollytelling my life</h1>
<h2>Author: <notb>TJ de Laveaga</notb></h2>
<h2>Description: <notb>This project is heavily inspired by the dear data project.
    I will be collecting extensive data about myself for a week and then making various
    visualizations out of it, and explaining the different patterns in my life through
    scrollytelling.
